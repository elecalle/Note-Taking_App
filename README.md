# Note-Taking_App

## Purpose 
This is a note-taking app, useful for people working on several projects at 
the same time and who want to be able to update multiple documents at the same 
time and from the same window. 

## Structure
There are six text widgets in total: 5 corresponding to 5 different projects, 1
("Misc", from "Miscellaneous"for taking impromptu notes on anything else that is 
not related to those 5 projects. 
You write your notes on the desired text widget. Once you're done, you click on 
the green tick button, which saves what you've written in a corresponding .txt 
file, and automatically clears the text widget for you. On the txt file, entries 
appear together with the date and time of writing, unless there is already an entry
on that txt file with the same data, in which case only the time of writing is 
indicated. Above every widget there's a button with the name of the corresponding
project. If clicked, that button opens the .txt document associated with that
widget. 
The red cross button clears the text widget (note: I had that link to a function in 
a previous version of this code, then I removed the function but left the button, 
and I still haven't gotten around to linking it again)
